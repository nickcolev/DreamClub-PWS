<h1>APWS Business Model</h1>

<p class="note"><a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/">A business model describes how a company creates, delivers and captures value.</a></p>

<p>In the context of the business model definition above, I have no idea how to run this. So, this first document on the matter probably will be far from the reality <small>(I might laugh later, when I read it)</small>. It would be fun to see what I thought, and what happened.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="#distr">Distribution</a></li>
 <li><a href="#supp">Support</a></li>
 <li><a href="#cf">Cash</a></li>
 <li><a href="#brand">Branding</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="distr">Distribution Channels</h3>
<p>Main channel to be <a href="/~google/">Google</a> <small>(as it is Android app)</small>. If in the future an iOS version is developed &mdash; Apple channel shall be used. Alternatively, a site with link for download and PayPal payment could be set up.</p>

<h3 id="supp">Support</h3>
<p>The support is a serious matter. I can't provide phone support <small>(shall I be able to handle phone support?! maybe via some VoIP solution?)</small>. Site with help/documentation should be provided <small>(where? Does it worth to register a domain, when not clear if there will be purchases? Is it <q>serious</q> enough if I put documentation on a blog?)</small>. <tt>nickcolev@gmail.com</tt> shall be used <small>(probably it shall be seen by the customers somewhere in the Google Play; A folder can be dedicatied; A separate account would be burden, unnecessary complication)</small>.</p>
	
<h3 id="cf">Cash Flow</h3>
<p>Going to rely on the payment mechanisms of Google Play. It requires registration of Google Play Developer Console account <a class="fa fa-external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" title="Wikipedia"></a> with $25 fee. The distribution is 30% for Google <small>(operating costs)</small> vs 70% for the developer. The revenue is paid via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="brand">Branding</h3>
<p>Is it necessary?! If this app yield a good impression &mdash; next apps <small>(from the same author)</small> would be better accepted. The question is how to brand &mdash; as myself, as Vera5, as Peter <small>(dad)</small>, Nick &amp; Assoc.?</p>
